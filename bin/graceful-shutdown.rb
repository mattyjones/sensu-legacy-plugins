# Graceful Shutdown Handler
# ===
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   This handler is responsible for handling graceful shutdown messages.
#   Upon receipt of the message a stash entry is created, signifying
#   that the client is starting to shutdown.
#
#   This stash entry can be used as metadata by keepalive handlers
#   to determine if a machine was gracefully shutdown or not.
#
# OUTPUT:
#   plain-text
#
# PLATFORMS:
#   all
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   gem: sensu-handler
#
# Requires a Sensu configuration snippet:
#   {
#     "graceful-shutdown": {
#       "expires": 120,
#       "keyspace": "graceful-shutdown",
#       "remove_client": true,
#     }
#   }
